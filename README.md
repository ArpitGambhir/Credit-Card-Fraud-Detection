Analyzing the frauds in the credit card dataset.

# Model
I have used Random Forest Algorithm to find the important features in the dataset, which I have used as input features to the Support Vector Machine algorithm. I found results from both Random Forest and SVM, to compare them. Main task was to find the frauds in the dataset. The dataset contains 492 cases of frauds.
