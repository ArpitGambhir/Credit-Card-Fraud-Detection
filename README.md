# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Analyzing the frauds in the credit card dataset.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud

# Model
I have used Support Vector Machines to find the frauds in the dataset. The dataset is too large, so it needs some formatting. I am considering 10000 cases from the dataset, out of which 492 cases are frauds.
